In mid-2018, Motorola had kind of a fresh start in the country through their national distributor Smart Technologies Limited. They opened up showrooms and online brand shops with three official releases from their E series for the low-mid range users in September 2018. After that, Motorola One was introduced for mid-range consumers. Their pricing and specs are so far well-accepted by the potential buyers. Solid build quality, long backup battery and authentic camera are especially admirable in their current releases.</p>
